# So what's the difference between AzureRM and Az commands in PowerShell

This is a great questions so I thought I'd take some time to explain what's going on here.

When Azure came on line, PowerShell was a major tool in the management of Azure resources so modules were create to manage Azure. Over time, there was a shift in how Azure was managed to using the Azure Resource Manager. Because of this change, a second set of PowerShell tools was created. These are the ones many of you are familar with the AzureRM module.
